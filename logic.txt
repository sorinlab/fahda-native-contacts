Logic behind summarizing all data's native contact information
(implemented in the original "03" script written by A. Radcliff and K. Nguyen)

1. initializes all variables

2. reads in native contacts data from 01.c output
	- in tandem: fills in hashmap for all {i,j} pairs
	- define if on excluded or native contact lists (comparing to $P)

3. reads in all_contact_P$proj data file
	- checks the timestamp and extracts P/R/C/T
	- foreach contact 
		- check distance and compares to $D = [mean + 2SD] 
		- (in each frame) assigning 2'/3' structure
		- output line states contact status

4. Every time a new timestamp is found
	- print previous frame info
